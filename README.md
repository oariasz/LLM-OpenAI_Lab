## Prompting Principles
1.  Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
    1.1 Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
    1.2 Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
    1.3 Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied
    1.4 Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting
 


2.  Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”
    2.1. Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task
    2.2 Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
